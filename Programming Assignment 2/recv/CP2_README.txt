Start the server program first by running the following command in the terminal:

The server's IP will be printed. Copy this for use in the client program.

Start the client program by running the following command in the terminal:
$ java ClientCP1.java [yourFileName] [ServerIP]
e.g. java ClientCP1 sample.text 175.000.0.000
